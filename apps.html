<h4>Client-side JavaScript applications</h4>
<h2>About Apps.Berlin.JS</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Apps.Berlin.Js</strong> is a Berlin.js spin-off with a special focus on JavaScript running in the browser on top of HTML & CSS. This includes JavaScript-driven web applications (“HTML5 apps”), desktop browser apps as well as mobile apps and games written in JavaScript.
</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>  
  Our goal is to have high quality talks with a low entry barrier. We’d like to attract people who are familiar with developing JavaScript apps, as well as people who are new in this world.

<p>
  We also aim to promote discussions and hear voices from different backgrounds. Therefore we usually have…
</p>

  <li>Two slots for 5-10 min talks + discussion</li>
</ul>
