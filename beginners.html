  #Client-side JavaScript applications
  ##About Apps.Berlin.JS

  **Apps.Berlin.Js** is a Berlin.js spin-off with a special focus on JavaScript running in the browser on top of HTML & CSS. This includes JavaScript-driven web applications (“HTML5 apps”), desktop browser apps as well as mobile apps and games written in JavaScript.

  ###How it works

  Our goal is to have high quality talks with a low entry barrier. We’d like to attract people who are familiar with developing JavaScript apps, as well as people who are new in this world.

  We also aim to promote discussions and hear voices from different backgrounds. Therefore we usually have…


  - Two slots for 15-20 min talks + discussion and
  - Two slots for 5-10 min talks + discussion

  If you would like to give a presentation, just drop us a mail!

  In case you’ve missed the recent apps.berlin.js meetup, you can browse the slides of all past editions.
