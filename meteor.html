  #Meteor user group: A better way to build apps
  ##About Meteor.Berlin.JS

  **Meteor.Berlin.Js** is a Meteor user group under the Berlin.JS umbrella. [Meteor](meteorjs.org) is an exciting new way of building web applications, blurring the line between front-end and back-end code.

  ###How it works

  Since Meteor is so new and has so much momentum, we formed an user group to have a space to share experiences and learn together. We want to hear about your project, your struggles and gotchas, and your insights.

  Each meeting we plan to have one 15-20 minute talk; then a 30-45 min round of open discussion and questions, tips, etc; then one or two slots for 5 minute “flash talks”.

  If you would like to give a presentation, just drop us a mail!
slots:
  1: 15-20 min talk
  2: 5-10 min flash talk
  3: 5-10 min flash talk
